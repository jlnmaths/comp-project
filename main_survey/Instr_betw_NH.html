<p>
    Dear participants,
</p>
<p>
This is the beginning of the second phase of the experiment.</p>
<p>
    In the following, you will again be asked to make six independent decisions. You will again be confronted with the same datasets.
</p>
<p>
    This time, however, you have the opportunity to reveal additional rows of the dataset or a hint which can help you form an assessment (described in detail below). You can choose at most one of these options for the small cost of solving a Captcha (like at the start of this experiment), and you do not have to choose either. You can of course state a different assessment than in phase 1.
    In addition to your assessment of the probability, we again ask you to state the degree of certainty you have in your assessment after every round.
</p>
<p>
     Reminder: At the end of the experiment, one of your decisions in phase 1 or phase 2 will be chosen at random and your payoff will be calculated using the formula described at the beginning, such that it is always optimal to state your true assessment.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Hints</h4>
The hints can help you assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 behind the question mark (?).
The hints point out a possible relation between main and the side observations. This can be the true relationship, but it is not necessarily so.
For instance, the fact that the main observation (Y) is only 1 if the side observation E2 is also 1 in the visible part of the dataset could be because the main observation depends on the side observation E2. But it could also be due to chance.
For each of the datasets, you are presented with a single hint.
</p>
