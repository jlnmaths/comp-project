<p>
    You can earn between $1 and $3 in this experiment.
</p>
<p>
    Your payoff is calculated as follows: First, we randomly select one of the three rounds you played.
    You are then assigned to another participant of the experiment who plays the role of receiver.
</p>
<p>
    Your assigned receiver sees the table and hint you have chosen in the selected round and is asked to assess with which probability there is a 1 behind the question mark (?). The higher this stated probability is, the higher your payoff.
</p>
<p>
    The receiver is payed in such a way that it is optimal for them to state their true assessment of the probability.
</p>
<p>
    <h5>Exact calculation of your payoff:</h5>
     Your assigned receiver states a number between 0 and 100 which we call p. This p represents the probability in % with which they believe there is a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?). You then receive a payment of $ 1 + p/100*2. For instance, if your assigned receiver states a probability of 50%, you obtain a total payment of $2.
