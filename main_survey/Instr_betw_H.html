<p>
    Dear participants,
</p>
<p>
This is the beginning of the second phase of the experiment.</p>
<p>
    In the following, you will again be asked to make six independent decisions. You will again be confronted with the same datasets.
</p>
<p> This time, however, you have the opportunity to reveal additional rows of the dataset or additional hints. You can choose at most one of these options for the small cost of solving a Captcha (like at the start of this experiment), and you do not have to choose either. You can of course state a different assessment than in phase 1.
    In addition to your assessment of the probability, we again ask you to state the degree of certainty you have in your assessment after every round.
</p>
<p>
     As a reminder: At the end of the experiment, one of your decisions in phase 1 or phase 2 will be chosen at random and your payoff will be calculated using the formula described in the beginning, such that it is optimal to state your true assessment.
</p>
