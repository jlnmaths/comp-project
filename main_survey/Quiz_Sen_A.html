  In this experiment you play three independent rounds of a persuasion task. Independent means that you cannot infer from one round to another.
  In each of the three rounds, you see two datasets in the form of tables and four "hints", two per table. The tables have a question mark (?) in the last row, and the hints are sentences which point out a relationship between the values in the table in order to help receivers decide whether there is a 0 or a 1 behind that question mark (?).
  You will be asked to choose one of the tables and one of the hints. Another participant of the experiment (a receiver) will see the combination you chose without any additional information. You want to choose the combination in such a way that this receiver reports a high probability that there is a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?).
</p>
<h4>
  Tables
</h4>
<p>
  The tables consist of 9 rows and 4 columns, see the example table below. Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. In the first column you see 8 entries of the main observation (Y); in columns 2 to 4 you see 9 entries for each of the three side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
  In the 9th row the main observation (Y) is missing but you can see the side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
</p>
<p>
  Each row represents observations that were made simultaneously.
  Please note that there is no temporal relationship between the different rows. It is therefore not true that the events that have led to the entries in the first row have necessarily happened before the events that have led to the entries in the 9th row.
</p>
<p>
  There may or may not be a causal relationship between the main and the three side observations. Whether causal or not, the relationship between the observations is the same in each row.
</p>

  <h4> The hints </h4>
  The hints point out potential relationships between the main observation and the side observations. Hints will be more or less explicit and you can choose which to send.
</p>
<p>
  <h4> Your task </h4>
Your task is to convince a receiver that the entry hidden behind the question mark (?) in the last row of the main observation is equal to 1. On a scale of 0 to 100 the receiver states the probability that this entry is equal to 1.
To convince the receiver that there is a 1 behind the question mark (?), you have two tools at your disposal. You will be shown two tables, which slightly differ in their content. For each of the tables you will be shown two hints that argue that there is a 1 behind the question mark (?). You must first choose one of the tables, and then one of the hints referring to the datasets. Your chosen combination of dataset and hint will be sent to the receiver.
</p>

<p>
  The receiver only sees the dataset you chose and the corresponding hint that you chose. They are asked to report their assessment of the probability that there is a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?), and they are paid in such a way that it is optimal for them to state their true assessment.
</p>
            <p>
    You receive a fixed payoff of $1 for your participation. Additionally, you receive a payoff of up to $2 depending on your choices in the experiment. You can therefore earn between $1 and $3.
</p>
<p>
    First, we randomly select one of the three rounds you played.
    You are then assigned to another participant of the experiment who plays the role of receiver. Your assigned receiver sees the table and hint you have chosen in the selected round and is asked to assess with which probability there is a 1 behind the question mark (?). The higher this stated probability is, the higher your payoff.
    The receiver is payed in such a way that it is optimal for them to state their true assessment of the probability.
</p>
<p>
    <h5>Exact calculation of your payoff:</h5>
     Your assigned receiver states a number between 0 and 100 which we call p. This p represents the probability in % with which they believe there is a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?). You then receive a payment of $ 1 + p/100*2. For instance, if your assigned receiver states a probability of 50%, you obtain a total payment of $2.
